Tworld is copyright (c) 2013, Andrew Plotkin. It is open-source under
the MIT license. See the LICENSE file. It will *always* be available
under the MIT license, but I may someday also make it available under
a different license.

For simplicity, I intend to maintain this entire application under my
ownership. (Except for the third-party jQuery libraries which are
noted in the README file.)

Therefore, if you contribute code to Tworld, I will ask that you transfer
the copyright to me.
