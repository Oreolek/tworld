Requirements:

Python 3 (3.3 or later)
MongoDB (2.4 or later)
Tornado (3.0 or later)
PyMongo (2.5 or later)
Motor (0.1)

Typically you will install Python 3 and MongoDB with your package manager;
on MacOS, I use Homebrew. Python comes with its own package manager, pip3;
use this to install Tornado, PyMongo, and Motor.
