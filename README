Tworld -- a choice-based shared online text environment sandbox

Tworld pre-release version 0.01.
Designed by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>.


Tworld is a text MUD engine in a new style. It runs as a web application,
offering hypertext environments (hyperlink-based actions rather than a
command line). Players can construct new areas in a wiki-style interface.
The intent is to have a modern, easily-accessible shared world, which
blends the lightweight social environment of a chat MUD with the inviting
collaborative sandbox of a wiki.


* Caveats

Tworld is still in development. It is not finished yet! The wiki-style
building interface is still vapor. The scripting system is a rudimentary
placeholder. The database schema is likely to change in non-compatible
ways before Tworld hits beta, never mind 1.0.


* Requirements:

Python 3 (3.3 or later)
MongoDB (2.4 or later)
Tornado (3.0 or later)
PyMongo (2.4 or later)
Motor (0.1)

Typically you will install Python 3 and MongoDB with your package manager;
on MacOS, I use Homebrew. Python comes with its own package manager, pip3;
use this to install Tornado, PyMongo, and Motor.
