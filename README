Tworld -- a choice-based shared online text environment sandbox

Tworld pre-release version 0.01.
Designed by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>.

Tworld is a text MUD engine in a new style. It runs as a web application,
offering hypertext environments (hyperlink-based actions rather than a
command line). Players can construct new areas in a wiki-style interface.
The intent is to have a modern, easily-accessible shared world, which
blends the lightweight social environment of a chat MUD with the inviting
collaborative sandbox of a wiki.


* Caveats

Tworld is still in development. It is not finished yet! The wiki-style
building interface is still vapor. The scripting system is a rudimentary
placeholder. The database schema is likely to change in non-compatible
ways before Tworld hits beta, never mind 1.0.


* Requirements

Python 3 (3.3 or later)
MongoDB (2.4 or later)
Tornado (3.1 or later)
PyMongo (2.4 or later)
Motor (0.1)

Typically you will install Python 3 and MongoDB with your package manager;
on MacOS, I use Homebrew. Python comes with its own package manager, pip3;
use this to install Tornado, PyMongo, and Motor.


* Installation notes

At the moment, you're on your own. I will regularize and document this
as the system gets closer to beta.

The overview: Tworld runs as a trio of daemon processes (mongod, tweb, and
tworld). To run them, you will need a private server, or a shared compute
service such as Linode or Amazon EC2. Tworld is not suitable for a shared
web-hosting service; these usually forbid long-running processes such as
chat and MUD apps.
